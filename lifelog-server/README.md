This will be the backend server that proceses my lifelog data.

Functionality:
- Remove redundant data (for example, if the screen logger screenshots have not changed that much for a long period of time, remove the "in between" screenshots to save disk space)
- Be able to query my data in a meaningful way.
- Create backups of my data.
- Index my data for faster querying.
