Querying this database is a significant challenge and point of research. I need to think about how to query this database and what a query really is so I can support future queries better.

In general, it seems like there are 'classes' of queries. For example, there are part-matching queries (such as searching for text) as well as vector-search queries (such as searching for similar images).

In general, a query should be a Boolean expression of other queries
