# Lifelog gRPC Integration Changes

## Backend Changes

### Proto Definition
- Created `proto/lifelog.proto` file defining service interfaces and message types
- Defined set of RPCs including data retrieval, user authentication, and logger management

### Server Implementation
- Added `server/src/grpc.rs` implementing the `LifelogService` trait
- Created placeholder implementations for all defined gRPC methods
- Set up proper error handling and response formatting
- Integrated with existing database functionality
- Fixed gRPC server implementation to properly use the imported service from the library crate
- Updated `Database::new()` method to be async and return a `Result` for better error handling

### Server Configuration
- Updated `server/src/main.rs` to initialize and run the gRPC server
- Added gRPC-Web support for browser clients
- Configured environment variables for gRPC server IP and port:
  ```
  GRPC_SERVER_IP=127.0.0.1
  GRPC_SERVER_PORT=50051
  ```
- Set up the gRPC server to run concurrently with the HTTP server
- Created dedicated `server/src/bin/grpc_server.rs` for running the gRPC server separately
- Improved signal handling for graceful shutdown in the gRPC server
- Added proper tracing support for better observability

## Frontend Changes

### Client Implementation
- Created `interface/src/lib/grpcWebClient.ts` implementing the gRPC-Web client
- Implemented methods corresponding to all defined server RPCs
- Added proper error handling and response parsing
- Set up environment configuration for the gRPC endpoint

### Protobuf Generation
- Generated TypeScript definitions from protobuf in `interface/src/generated/`
- Created proper typings for all message types

### Dependencies
- Installed necessary npm packages:
  ```
  @improbable-eng/grpc-web
  google-protobuf
  protobufjs
  ```

### Component Integration
- Created `interface/src/components/ui/GrpcExample.tsx` for demonstrating gRPC functionality
- Implemented logger status retrieval, toggling, and snapshot features
- Added the component to the main application in `App.tsx`

### Environment Configuration
- Added environment variable for gRPC endpoint:
  ```
  VITE_GRPC_API_URL=http://localhost:50051
  ```

## Future Work
- Complete implementation of all service methods
- Add authentication to gRPC calls
- Implement streaming for relevant endpoints
- Convert existing REST API consumers to use gRPC
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging

## Known Issues
- Some placeholder implementations need to be replaced with actual business logic
- Authentication is not yet fully implemented
- Streaming endpoints need full implementation
