TODOS:

- Change the register collector to give the mac of the device
- Refactor the code in the sync_data function to be "universal"
- Think about the query, get data pipeline for the collectors
- Send queries out to the frontend

- Create transformation pipeline
- Store blobs in a file

- Improve the collector configs, get a new configuration pipeline for this project (server, collectors, etc.)
- Implement the get and set config functions for the collectors and server
